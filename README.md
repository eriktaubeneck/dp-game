# Differential Privacy Game
This game is designed to demonstrate the effect of decision making for advertising professionals with differentially private results.

Through this research, we are trying to understand if advertising practitioners are presented with noisy results, how likely are they to make the same decision?
We plan to experiment with a set of epsilon values to research on utility of adding noise to the results.
